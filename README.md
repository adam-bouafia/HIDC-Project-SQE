# Health Informatics and Data Collaboration (HIDC) - Software Quality Engineering Homework (Univaq)

This repository contains my homework submissions for the Software Quality Engineering course at the University of L'Aquila (Univaq) for the academic year 2023-2024. The assignments focus on UML software modeling and performance analysis of the Research Infrastructure for Big Data and Social Mining (SoBigData) system.

## About

The homework projects aim to demonstrate practical applications of software quality engineering principles including UML diagramming, system modeling, performance analysis, and optimization within a defined software engineering context.

### Homework 1: UML Software Modeling

The first assignment involved creating UML diagrams to model the SoBigData system, focusing on the integration of various UML views including static, dynamic, and deployment views. The models were developed using MagicDraw, adhering to a defined UML profile for the SoBigData application domain.

**Key components of this homework:**
- Use Case Diagrams
- Sequence Diagrams
- Component Diagrams
- Deployment Diagrams

### Homework 2: Software Performance Modeling and Analysis

The second assignment extended the first by modeling and analyzing the software performance based on the UML diagrams created. This included defining performance requirements, assigning resource demands, and modeling a Queueing Network to identify and resolve potential bottlenecks.

**Key aspects of this homework:**
- Performance requirements definition
- Queueing Network modeling using JMT
- Worst-case analysis and bottleneck resolution
- Optional What-If analysis to explore performance under varying parameters

## Tools Used

- **MagicDraw:** For UML diagramming and modeling.
- **Java Modelling Tools (JMT):** For performance analysis and queueing network modeling.

## Installation

Instructions on how to view and interact with the models and analyses:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/adam-bouafia/HIDC-Project-SQE.git

2. For UML models, open the files using MagicDraw.
3. For performance analysis, JMT files can be opened using Java Modelling Tools software.

## Contributing

While this repository is primarily for academic submission, suggestions or discussions on the models and their improvement are welcome. Please feel free to submit issues or pull requests.
